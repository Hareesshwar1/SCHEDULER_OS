This code is a graphical user interface (GUI) application for simulating various CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, HPF, RR, and SRTN using tkinter for the GUI and matplotlib for plotting. 

It allows users to select an input file containing process details, choose an algorithm, visualize the scheduling timeline, and optionally write the output to a file.
